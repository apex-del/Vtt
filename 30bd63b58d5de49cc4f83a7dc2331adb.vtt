00:52.427 --> 00:54.596
Did you hear about Mrs. Hazel?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.640
She was arrested for spying.

00:56.765 --> 01:01.353
Information on Rogers Bank
is being leaked to Westalis.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.357
That'll get the attention of
the State Security Service.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.361
Ostanians will not
yield to such threats.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.619
Perhaps you've had too much?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.622
You should lie down.

01:22.249 --> 01:26.920
It's fine. He's enjoying himself too.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.717
We know of the scandalous rumors
concerning Chairman Bernard.

01:31.842 --> 01:32.926
Scandalous rumors?

01:34.845 --> 01:38.181
Of what sort? Do tell.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.769
Of course, the night is long.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.190
Please rest for a while.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.716
I drank too much.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.509
Are you alone?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.678
Not anymore.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.349
Let's go back.
I want something sweet to eat.

02:45.874 --> 02:50.879
Good day, or perhaps, good evening,
I've obtained the missile deployment blueprints,

02:51.171 --> 02:54.883
stabilizing the balance
between East and West.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.805
His name is Loid, codename, "Twilight

02:59.930 --> 03:03.392
<i>A spy for the Westalian Intelligence
Services' Eastern-Focused Division.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:07.062
Rest assured,
I'll execute the mission perfectly.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.526
Kill them! It's just a single enemy!

03:19.199 --> 03:22.661
W...what the...? Who are you?

03:23.954 --> 03:28.667
You are Director Cassado
of Surfoka Aviation, correct?

03:29.668 --> 03:35.173
I hear you're the traitorous scumbag
illegally selling weapons to Westalis.

03:36.508 --> 03:42.180
Terribly sorry but may I have
the honor of taking your life?

03:49.771 --> 03:56.486
Her name is Yor. An assassin of
unearthly skill known as “Thorn Princess.”

04:04.119 --> 04:07.247
A spy and an assassin
of exceptional prowess,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.166
these two are in fact...

04:10.751 --> 04:13.253
Welcome home, Yor.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.423
Have a good day at the hospital, Loid?

04:16.548 --> 04:17.758
A married couple.

04:18.592 --> 04:25.098
But its a sham used by him for
a mission and by her as a coverup.

04:25.432 --> 04:29.019
And neither knows
the others true identity.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.564
Welcome home, Papa and Mama!

04:32.773 --> 04:36.943
<i>The girl is Anya,
an orphan adopted for his mission.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:39.529
She foo holds a secret

04:39.654 --> 04:41.323
Were you a good girl?

04:42.532 --> 04:46.119
I must develop the hidden
camera film by morning.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.290
Hidden camera! Spies are so cool!

04:50.457 --> 04:51.583
So exciting!

04:51.708 --> 04:54.127
<i>She's a telepath.</i>

04:54.669 --> 04:58.215
Phew, glad I made it home for dinner.

04:58.465 --> 05:03.553
<i>I had grenades and tank missiles
thrown at me. What a day!</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:07.307
She had a massive fight before dinner!

05:07.432 --> 05:11.394
You must be hungry.
I'll cook up an omelet.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.900
Bond is the family dos.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.621
A lab animal, he can foresee the future.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.874
There's danger if we let Mama cook!

05:33.375 --> 05:37.087
Anya wants Papa's specialty.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.423
You mean...peanut-butter pizza?

05:40.549 --> 05:41.675
Yeah, that one!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.343
Sounds nice.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.680
Okay. I'll add some meat on top.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.933
Meat, meat, hurray!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.947
Cooking class?

06:04.072 --> 06:09.327
Correct, Anya Forger.
Dessert making is a school tradition.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.497
Boy, you really are clueless.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.833
What an idiot.

06:15.083 --> 06:19.796
Lay off. All we have to do
is make yummy sweets.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.756
Anya likes sweets.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.886
You don't eat it, you make it. Get it?

06:26.052 --> 06:29.264
Bet she only knows peasant sweets.

06:29.431 --> 06:34.060
Dummy, no way she can make
anything for human consumption.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.354
You've got that right, Lord Damian.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.898
Absolutely.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.441
Numskull Second Son.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.276
Not elegant.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.863
Refrain from talking.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.616
It's Second Son's fault.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.867
Shut up, you're the...

06:52.537 --> 06:56.666
This year's judge will be our principal.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.878
Last year's winner
received a Stella Star.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.298
Stella Star...

07:04.049 --> 07:07.969
At the prestigious Eden College,
students who excel

07:08.094 --> 07:11.139
are given medals known as Stella Star.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.975
Those who collect eight stars can

07:14.100 --> 07:18.229
<i>attend gatherings reserved
for the school's elite.</i>

07:19.314 --> 07:23.151
<i>To get close to
a prominent Ostania politician,</i>

07:23.276 --> 07:28.823
Twilight's mission, Operation Strix,
requires accessing the gathering.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.868
The politician is Donovan Desmond.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.372
This is why he formed a fake family

07:35.497 --> 07:38.792
and enrolled his daughter
Anya in Eden.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.797
"Training is at 2:00 pm Monday.
You may choose any sweet.”

07:44.172 --> 07:48.426
"I expect all to be fully prepared
and to cook elegantly.”

07:49.427 --> 07:51.304
Monday at 2:00 pm...

07:51.763 --> 07:54.599
Weekend will be spent making sweets.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.565
Code F?

08:27.841 --> 08:32.470
Good day, or perhaps, good evening.
Agent Twilight.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.473
What's is it, Handler?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.852
I've a new undercover operation for you.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.861
There's no time for
such a vast operation.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.613
And I'm busy with Operation Strix.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.323
You can chuck that.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.329
This is Major Depple
of Army Intelligence.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.458
He'll take over Operation Strix.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.254
This man is incompetent.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.631
And Desmond is very cautious.

09:08.757 --> 09:13.178
Depple lacks the experience
and skill to fulfill the mission.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.929
The risk is too big.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.684
I agree. But the decision
comes from headquarters.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.438
Depple is backed by
a prominent committee member.

09:23.605 --> 09:28.276
To get more budget,
the guys upstairs couldn't say no.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.655
If there were some progress on our side,

09:32.781 --> 09:35.742
we could've protested but...

09:44.334 --> 09:47.170
They know nothing about the situation.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.674
<i>HQ is unaware of the delicate
balance between East and West.</i>

10:01.476 --> 10:02.519
Please.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.895
Thank you.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.034
He thinks he can get away with cheating.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.202
Get real.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.926
Here you go.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.766
You're so kind. How can I thank you Twilight,
why are you here? Is Strix going okay?

10:44.561 --> 10:48.064
No worries. What a nice hat. Agents
shouldn't snoop on each other, Nightfall.

10:48.231 --> 10:54.529
Manipulating their mouths and pronunciation,
spies have coded conversations.

10:54.821 --> 11:04.330
<i>W's hard 10 come by, but a friend gave Wt 10 me as a gift.
It's no good using amateurs as family members on missions.</i>

10:56.865 --> 10:56.990
It's imported,
made of top quality material.

10:58.825 --> 10:58.992
Its no good using amateurs
as family members on missions.

11:01.244 --> 11:01.369
It's hard to come by,
but a friend gave it to me as a gift.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.044
Loid...

11:13.631 --> 11:16.426
Did he kiss that woman?

11:16.634 --> 11:19.053
Yor, are you listening?

11:19.637 --> 11:21.306
Oh? What is it?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.979
What were we talking about?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.815
Ah, about cheating men.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.858
Cheating?

11:34.360 --> 11:38.615
There are three signs.
Number one, more business trips.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.117
Overnight stays are suspect.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.870
Number two, a change in attire.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.414
He wants to match his new woman.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.875
Number three, an unexpected gift.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.085
To make up for guilty feelings.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.253
Simpletons.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.260
Are men really like that?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.887
Without a doubt.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.974
All my divorced friends attest to it.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.784
I'm dismissed from Operation Strix.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.871
<i>That means I'll have to move out.</i>

12:30.124 --> 12:32.460
Who was that woman?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.462
Is she Loid's lover?

12:34.754 --> 12:39.342
<i>But if she is,
why ask me to pretend to be his wife?</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:45.306
Could he be looking for
a new mother for Miss Anya?

12:45.556 --> 12:50.645
<i>Was I not good enough
to be a wife and mother?</i>

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
Anya is back home!

12:53.731 --> 12:56.609
It's a special, school mission.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.444
Cooking class...

12:58.653 --> 13:01.614
We'll make sweets for a first prize.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.201
My, such an interesting class.

13:07.954 --> 13:13.376
If Anya wins a Stella Star, it'll show
Operation Strix IS making progress.

13:14.085 --> 13:17.255
Handler can use this against HQ's order.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.884
Becky's making whatchamacallit cake.
Second Son's making a thingamajig.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.097
<i>This year's judge is the principal.</i>

13:26.264 --> 13:30.101
<i>I saw data of his culinary
preferences somewhere.</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:37.692
How about making meremere?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.361
meremere?

13:40.486 --> 13:42.655
The principal's favorite dessert.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.991
How do you know?

13:45.616 --> 13:48.745
I came across it in a school newsletter.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.999
In particular, the meremere
from his hometown of Frigis.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.960
Anya wants to eat that!

13:56.085 --> 13:59.839
It's an old dessert,
difficult to find around here.

14:00.340 --> 14:05.553
Data says the restaurant
he ate at served it with a twist.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.057
Let's go to Frigis for some.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.810
If we're aiming to win,
we should try it.

14:16.606 --> 14:20.401
It's a bit far so let's
make it an overnight trip.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.278
Let's go!

14:25.323 --> 14:26.783
Overnight...

14:27.617 --> 14:30.078
Number one, more business trips.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.622
<i>Does this count as a business trip?</i>

14:32.747 --> 14:34.999
A sign of cheating? Burt ..

14:35.124 --> 14:38.336
We're going on an ooting!

14:40.254 --> 14:43.216
It's not for fun and games, okay?

14:44.425 --> 14:49.389
Aye, sir. Rest assured, the fabled
meremere will be mine. Glint.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.433
It's not fabled.
It's in ordinary restaurants.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.228
Yor, are you free this weekend?

14:55.353 --> 14:56.604
You're asking me too?

14:57.105 --> 15:02.610
<i>Apparently, the restaurant I want
to visit only allows families.</i>

15:02.985 --> 15:05.780
If he's asking me, does it mean

15:05.905 --> 15:08.366
this isn't a sign of cheating?

15:08.658 --> 15:10.201
Have you other plans?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.203
Oh no, I'm good to go!

15:12.370 --> 15:13.871
Great.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.624
Well, shall we all go to Frigis?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.709
- Okay.
- Yay!

16:48.424 --> 16:50.635
Anya doesn't like study.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.262
We just went over this.

16:53.554 --> 16:57.141
<i>Basic academic ability is
a must to acquire Stellas.</i>

16:57.517 --> 16:59.435
Papa, pee-pee.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.771
Can you go alone?

17:01.979 --> 17:03.272
Can do!

17:03.773 --> 17:05.149
Kids...

17:19.205 --> 17:20.623
What's this?

17:31.884 --> 17:35.972
The treasure everyone
in the Republic wants.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.557
If we can get it ..

17:38.808 --> 17:40.393
Treasure?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.645
A key to a treasure?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.280
So exciting!

17:56.450 --> 17:58.619
I can't decipher her handwriting.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.081
I helped her with it the other day.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.709
She's trying hard.

18:04.875 --> 18:08.337
She's not back yet.
I hope she's not lost.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.799
The mother role begins to suit you.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.135
Y...you think so?

18:14.260 --> 18:19.348
I thought Loid was
displeased with my mother act

18:19.682 --> 18:22.518
<i>It must be my wife role
he's unhappy with!</i>

18:23.811 --> 18:24.770
Yor?

18:25.980 --> 18:29.483
It's true, I'm hardly a perfect wife.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.033
Is your mouth alright?

18:37.283 --> 18:41.579
My new lipstick's giving
me an allergic reaction.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.874
Anyway, where is Miss Anya?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.585
I'd better look for her.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.675
Our marriage Is a masquerade.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.262
Loid is only playing his part.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.228
It was number 8 we saw.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.361
Here! This is it.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.160
Treasure!

19:26.457 --> 19:30.753
<i>No, Anya. Don't touch
what doesn't belong to you.</i>

19:31.420 --> 19:34.006
The treasure everyone
in the Republic wants.

19:34.423 --> 19:39.637
Wait a sec. World peace
IS in danger inside here.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.351
<i>We're the World Peace Patrol!</i>

20:06.455 --> 20:07.707
Chocolate?

20:07.832 --> 20:10.501
Can't be the secret item.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.171
You fool!

20:25.850 --> 20:27.184
Yum yum.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.063
You're dead if the Colonel hears
you lost the key, Luca.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.986
See, the horoscope says
be careful of losing stuff.

20:37.486 --> 20:41.532
I know it's a trunk
covered with ship stickers.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.451
We'll pry it open.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.247
They mean this?

20:59.759 --> 21:03.012
6... 7... 8...

21:03.846 --> 21:06.223
Should be around here.

21:06.891 --> 21:12.396
Do you know how hard it was
for our agent to steal it?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.775
Three years to infiltrate
the West's research lab?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.027
Yeah, serious business.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.989
The treasure everyone
in the Republic wants.

21:22.156 --> 21:26.202
With it, the equilibrium between
East and West will shift.

21:29.246 --> 21:33.667
We've created the number one
chocolate in Westalis!

21:40.382 --> 21:43.761
I, the Earl's spy,
take matters into my own hand!

21:43.928 --> 21:46.013
The best chocolate is mine!

21:46.263 --> 21:49.975
We'll reign as the world's
top chocolate maker!

21:50.100 --> 21:54.772
No! The chocolate industry
of the West is doomed...

21:55.105 --> 21:59.401
Chocolate robbers? Are they bad guys?

21:59.568 --> 22:03.072
Here it is. The trunk with stickers.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.827
It's been opened...

22:12.873 --> 22:15.292
There's nothing inside!

22:17.711 --> 22:20.464
Here's the key I dropped.

22:20.589 --> 22:24.009
Someone must have
opened it and taken it.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.302
Who could it be?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
Who knows?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.639
What'll we do?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.475
Must find them and get it back.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.812
To maintain secrecy, we'll have

22:35.938 --> 22:36.939
to Kill.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.983
Kill?!

22:42.862 --> 22:43.654
Who's there?

22:43.988 --> 22:48.117
My flower fortune reading
indicates you're close by.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.412
Over there!

22:59.837 --> 23:01.088
A kid?

23:01.338 --> 23:03.215
Did the brat eat it?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.092
To be on the safe side,

23:05.217 --> 23:07.136
I locked the door.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.847
Papa! Mama!

23:10.264 --> 23:14.143
No use. The door is shut tight.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.233
Mama!

23:21.358 --> 23:22.359
Miss Anya!

23:23.569 --> 23:25.821
Miss Anya, who are these gentlemen?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.740
Huh? Um...

23:28.073 --> 23:31.160
Her mother?
Your daughter's taken our choco...

23:31.285 --> 23:34.163
Chocolate thieves! They're bad guys!

23:34.830 --> 23:37.333
They wanna hurt me!

23:39.043 --> 23:41.003
<i>What a drag.</i>

23:41.128 --> 23:43.339
Might as well capture them both.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.470
Now now, Mom...

23:49.595 --> 23:52.681
Miss Anya, shut your eyes.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.855
Miss Anya, you can open them.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.525
Well... They seem to have

24:03.651 --> 24:05.486
toppled over.

24:06.904 --> 24:11.075
<i>Did Anya crush the bad guy's plan?</i>

24:24.755 --> 24:26.548
Whoa!

24:28.384 --> 24:30.636
Wow!

24:48.362 --> 24:51.865
Hey, let's go. We've work to do.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.537
Right. Miss Anya, Bond,
shall we move along?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.421
What is this?

25:05.546 --> 25:08.132
Must report.
To the Colonel.

25:08.757 --> 25:13.262
Restaurant Rubble & Bonds

25:24.314 --> 25:25.774
Here you are.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.443
Yum!

25:27.568 --> 25:28.777
Wipe your mouth.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.869
Is this the restaurant?

25:37.036 --> 25:40.622
Their policy is to only serve families.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.082
So exciting!

25:44.251 --> 25:47.588
Sorry Bond. Pets are not allowed.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.553
Ready to order?

25:55.012 --> 25:59.850
In addition to the lunch set,
we'll have beef pie and smoked salmon.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.643
Anya, the chicken sautee?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.270
Yeah, that one!

26:03.854 --> 26:07.024
And we'll have meremere for dessert.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.986
You're in luck.
We've only one more piece.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.322
Really? How fortunate.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.705
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's!

26:32.299 --> 26:35.177
Our specialty for you.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.231
Chicken saute with peanut sauce.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.440
Looks yummy!

26:48.649 --> 26:52.903
Mind your manners. Use a knife and fork.

26:53.028 --> 26:53.862
Yep.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.832
<i>It's unusual for Loid
to wear a turtleneck.</i>

27:05.374 --> 27:07.835
<i>Number two, a change in attire.</i>

27:08.168 --> 27:10.087
What! Oh no!

27:10.295 --> 27:12.131
Is that what it means?/

27:12.381 --> 27:15.050
It's cold here but I dressed foo warmly.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.594
Could it really be?

27:17.803 --> 27:20.681
I should ask about
that woman directly.

27:20.806 --> 27:24.852
If another has Loid's heart
what will become of me?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.645
Is anything wrong?

27:26.979 --> 27:28.605
No, nothing.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.525
<i>I'll ask when Miss Anya's not around.</i>

27:31.733 --> 27:34.653
Welcome to our restaurant,
Rubble & Bonds.

27:35.445 --> 27:38.073
Are you enjoying your meal?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.577
Very nice. Please call the chef.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.037
I am the chef.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.249
Rubble & Bonds is an unusual name.

27:47.457 --> 27:51.044
Did you see the military
aircraft by the station?

27:51.170 --> 27:51.837
Yes.

27:51.962 --> 27:57.676
It was flown by the ace duo
Recky and Brandon during the war.

27:58.635 --> 28:02.639
It was a fierce battle
in the skies of Frigis.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.058
Frigis!

28:06.226 --> 28:09.104
Did you just say Frigis?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.273
Their air force base was there.

28:11.440 --> 28:16.445
Details are sketchy,
but intelligence is working on it.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.531
I, Yuri Briar, request
a leave of absence.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.534
Hold on. What is it?

28:23.785 --> 28:26.705
My sister is vacationing in Frigis.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.000
She gets lost even in her home city.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.211
If she stumbles into trouble...

28:32.377 --> 28:34.922
The information is unconfirmed.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.798
Then I'll look into it!

28:36.924 --> 28:39.176
We are Security Service Officers.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.471
Don't meddle in military affairs.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.811
Sis!

28:50.687 --> 28:55.484
The repeated air strikes
took everything from me.

28:55.609 --> 28:59.071
My home, my family...
There was nothing to eat.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.699
I slept without a roof over my head.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.246
During that time, a child appeared.

29:07.496 --> 29:11.416
He needed help digging food
from out of the rubble.

29:11.667 --> 29:16.129
Like me, he was an orphan.

29:16.546 --> 29:20.759
So such a hellish scene
never happens again,

29:21.051 --> 29:23.011
I became a spy.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.598
Today, I recreate the pleasant taste

29:26.723 --> 29:30.018
of my mother's home cooking

29:30.185 --> 29:33.689
for others to enjoy.

29:34.022 --> 29:38.485
It's a self-indulgent way
to heal myself.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.623
And here is your meremere.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.292
Look at it!

29:53.417 --> 29:56.253
This meremere does look rather unique.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.757
<i>Military intelligence's special
reconnaissance regiment.</i>

30:01.049 --> 30:03.135
Why are they here?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.972
I smell something delicious.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.474
This place looks popular.

30:09.850 --> 30:14.313
I'm sorry but we only serve families.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.399
Bring me the mutton pastry
and cod curry pilaf.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.776
And meremere for dessert.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.236
But, um...

30:21.403 --> 30:25.032
I'm sorry, we're all out of meremere.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.867
Eh?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.787
Then, what is that?

30:31.246 --> 30:33.582
It's the last piece.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.251
It is still untouched.

30:38.003 --> 30:43.258
Please, we must ask that military
personnel respect our rules.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.929
In fortified zones, the military
is authorized with food control.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.266
I can have this restaurant closed.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.352
But...

30:54.269 --> 30:55.812
Excuse me...

30:56.688 --> 30:58.315
Good job, sirs.

30:58.440 --> 31:03.153
My daughter wanted meremere.
Can you order another dish?

31:03.653 --> 31:06.782
Tourists here to eat meremere?

31:06.907 --> 31:07.532
Yes.

31:07.657 --> 31:13.163
You travel to eat good food. That's nice.
Perhaps we can be friends.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.625
With similar interests,
why not have a match?

31:17.250 --> 31:22.172
If you win, I'll hand over
the meremere. Alright??

31:31.223 --> 31:34.893
Identify the sugars
used in these sweets.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.146
Write your answers here.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.150
Be as detailed as you can.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.528
If our answers are identical?

31:44.653 --> 31:47.656
Then I'll give you the round.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.160
Well, please begin.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.919
This whiskey cake
is baked to perfection.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.421
I give it 85 points.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.965
<i>He"s thinks I'm just a tourist.</i>

32:05.090 --> 32:08.677
But I've gone undercover as a fop chef.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.430
This battle will be mine.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.982
Reveal your answers.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.487
From the left,

32:27.654 --> 32:30.073
palm sugar, brown sugar,

32:30.282 --> 32:31.700
white sugar.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.660
C...correct.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.245
Fantastic.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.581
Papa is a sugar-meister.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.168
That was passable.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.211
Now, it's my turn.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.885
The amount of grams!

32:50.635 --> 32:51.970
How did I do?

32:52.095 --> 32:53.513
You're correct.

32:54.389 --> 32:58.435
My answers are more detailed.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.566
Dang, Papa lost...

33:04.691 --> 33:06.109
Oh dear.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.999
I enjoyed myself.
The meremere was spectacular.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.503
Thank you very much.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.590
Papa...

33:28.757 --> 33:32.636
It's okay. We'll have meremere tomorrow,

33:32.761 --> 33:35.764
and be home by Monday for cooking class.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.182
Well...

33:37.724 --> 33:41.895
The ingredients won't be
delivered until Monday.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.441
I see... Then may I have the recipe?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.985
It is not written down.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.405
Even if it were, I can't reveal it.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.448
Stingy.

33:53.615 --> 33:54.491
Hey.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.619
Why not consider making
a different sweet?

33:59.037 --> 34:03.833
Anya can't win in
a straightforward competition.

34:04.125 --> 34:08.547
<i>The only way to victory is
to serve the principal's favorite meremere.</i>

34:09.130 --> 34:11.800
Stella Star fading!

34:17.180 --> 34:22.060
What if.. .we gather all
the ingredients, can you make it?

34:22.352 --> 34:23.937
Sure, I can.

34:24.062 --> 34:24.938
Yor...

34:25.105 --> 34:27.941
It's too soon to give up.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.950
These are the ingredients.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.952
It's a pretty long list.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.161
No problem at all.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.373
This shop has dried cherries.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.584
Well get lingonberry here.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.337
That one has hazelnuts in the back row.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.590
It's all set

34:51.798 --> 34:53.508
I'll be right back.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.283
Next up is orange syrup.

35:18.408 --> 35:21.328
Young man. One for the wife?

35:21.870 --> 35:26.499
A gentle, moisturizing lipstick
that contains Frigis honey.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.084
"Wife"!

35:28.209 --> 35:30.045
Then, we'll take one.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.214
Loid, you don't have to...

35:33.340 --> 35:35.759
Your last lipstick was trouble, no?

35:38.053 --> 35:39.846
How's this color?

35:42.724 --> 35:46.102
Well...um... Yes, it's a nice color.

35:48.938 --> 35:50.315
Thank you.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.193
It's yours.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.862
D...does this mean...

35:56.821 --> 35:59.491
Number three, an unexpected gift

36:01.117 --> 36:03.578
You're giving me a present?

36:05.038 --> 36:06.081
Well, yes.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.959
She's seemed a bit downcast

36:10.168 --> 36:13.171
Caring for your partner is crucial.

36:13.713 --> 36:17.592
Signs of cheating...all three of them.

36:19.761 --> 36:20.720
Yor?

36:20.845 --> 36:22.681
I...

36:22.806 --> 36:25.266
I'm going to the restroom.

36:26.017 --> 36:26.935
Sure...

36:30.438 --> 36:34.234
<i>Exhaustion from travel?
I hope she's alright.</i>

36:34.359 --> 36:35.568
Papal!

36:38.071 --> 36:39.531
What is that?

36:47.247 --> 36:49.290
Sparkle, sparkle, glitter, glitter!

36:49.416 --> 36:51.418
Isn't that the city market?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.545
- So shiny!
- W...wait up!

37:00.427 --> 37:03.263
Stay close or you'll get lost.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.183
We'll return after the orange syrup.

37:07.350 --> 37:12.188
Win sweets, dolls,
and local orange syrup!

37:12.689 --> 37:14.357
Orange syrup!

37:14.482 --> 37:15.567
For real?

37:19.404 --> 37:21.114
It won't fall over.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.782
Daddy, you suck.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.410
Let me try again.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.918
Hook me up, old man.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.510
Go to hell, baby!

37:48.224 --> 37:50.477
Curses, they sure move fast.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.520
They're not moving.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.987
Damn! But I hit it!

38:01.780 --> 38:04.240
Ha, keep wasting your time.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.202
Try all you like,

38:07.494 --> 38:12.373
<i>but all but the bottom row
have reinforced backs.</i>

38:14.209 --> 38:16.377
He's an evil gunsmith/!

38:16.503 --> 38:20.965
I see. He's using a typical carny trick.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.890
Let me try.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.233
Going for the orange syrup, eh?

38:38.358 --> 38:40.777
Try your best.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.829
What are those?

38:51.412 --> 38:53.414
An incredible shot!

38:53.706 --> 38:56.626
Luck was with you, sir.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.253
Superb, superb!

38:58.378 --> 39:00.129
It wasn't luck.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.800
Shall I do it again?

39:05.468 --> 39:09.097
I think it's best to run
an honest business.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.808
Y...you're right.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.937
Bullseye! It's suddenly
easy to knock 'em down.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.815
One ingredient left.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.234
Anya, we're getting on the tram...

39:22.694 --> 39:25.154
Papal!

39:27.574 --> 39:29.242
Whee!

39:31.244 --> 39:32.495
Kids...

39:42.171 --> 39:45.008
Considering Loid's happiness,

39:45.800 --> 39:48.761
would it be best if I leave?

39:49.429 --> 39:53.182
We are a fake couple, after all.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.351
Papa, round and round!

39:55.476 --> 39:57.186
Yes, how nice.

39:57.604 --> 40:02.483
Of what entertainment value
ls there going around in circles?

40:02.817 --> 40:04.527
Children are a mystery.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.450
The lipstick looks good on you.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.161
Thank you.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.248
Shall we drink something? Hot coffee?

40:19.250 --> 40:22.295
I must know where I stand with Loid.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.630
But ..

40:23.796 --> 40:25.048
What will it be?

40:25.548 --> 40:28.676
Coffee for me, and Yor?

40:32.639 --> 40:34.140
Yor?

40:36.351 --> 40:40.271
<i>Alcohol will give me the courage to ask.</i>

40:46.611 --> 40:48.237
Wait, Yor...

40:48.696 --> 40:50.239
Why...

41:02.210 --> 41:04.337
Yor, are you alright?

41:04.754 --> 41:08.132
There's someone else, isn't there?

41:08.841 --> 41:12.178
Are you in love? Tell me already!

41:12.303 --> 41:13.638
You've had too much!

41:17.558 --> 41:20.144
Papa and Mama are flirting.

41:26.651 --> 41:30.238
Loid, you gotta answer me.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.157
Do you like me...

41:43.084 --> 41:44.502
Are you okay?

41:44.627 --> 41:46.087
Mama's a lush.

41:46.254 --> 41:50.341
I'm so sorry. What have I done?

41:53.177 --> 41:57.682
I've blown ft.
Loid must be fed up with me.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.019
I won't be surprised if
he wants a divorce.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.478
Divorce?

42:02.979 --> 42:07.358
Divorce is when a bloodbath
between parents erupts,

42:07.483 --> 42:09.777
causing the family to break up.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.530
Bloodbath
and falling apart!

42:12.989 --> 42:15.366
A flirting happy ride!

42:15.658 --> 42:17.827
Take a ride on the Ferris wheel!

42:17.952 --> 42:19.579
Flirting!

42:20.705 --> 42:22.373
Papa, Mama!

42:23.624 --> 42:25.293
I wanna ride that!

42:37.638 --> 42:39.474
Next, please!

42:43.102 --> 42:44.604
Aren't you getting in?

42:46.689 --> 42:48.566
Papa and Mama, be flirting.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.443
Flirting?

42:51.736 --> 42:54.781
Bond, look after Miss Anya.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.077
I thought she wanted to ride this.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.037
What's she up to?

43:01.204 --> 43:03.748
Did she notice my dark mood?

43:04.624 --> 43:09.128
<i>I shouldn't have let
Miss Anya worry about me.</i>

43:15.551 --> 43:18.012
Yor, are you okay?

43:18.179 --> 43:22.100
I'm so sorry...
I've acted disgracefully.

43:22.683 --> 43:26.354
Not that. You've been acting odd lately.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.358
I saw you.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.194
You and your lover.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.654
Lover?

43:34.779 --> 43:37.281
Yesterday. The lady with a large hat!

43:43.287 --> 43:46.499
It's a misunderstanding.
She sought directions.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.126
She's not my lover.

43:49.293 --> 43:53.381
She was looking for a museum.
I don't even know her name.

43:54.090 --> 43:57.260
Is that so...

44:07.228 --> 44:10.356
I thought you wanted to divorce me.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.150
Why would I?

44:12.275 --> 44:16.696
I don't think I'm
meeting your expectations.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.323
As a mother...

44:19.490 --> 44:21.659
As your wife...

44:26.330 --> 44:28.457
Didn't we make a promise, Yor?

44:28.916 --> 44:30.293
I promised...

44:30.960 --> 44:34.589
Even in sickness,
or in sadness...

44:35.131 --> 44:40.094
No matter what hardships await us,
let us be there for one another.

44:42.555 --> 44:46.017
I've no intention to break my promise.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.061
Loid... Oh my...

44:49.562 --> 44:52.190
Yor, am I unfit for you?

44:52.356 --> 44:55.026
I..I..

44:56.861 --> 44:57.862
Yor...

45:09.040 --> 45:10.333
Loid!

45:16.839 --> 45:18.341
Argh!

45:18.758 --> 45:21.969
Papa and Mama! Bloodbath!

45:23.054 --> 45:24.513
The Forgers are toast.

45:24.639 --> 45:27.725
No, not at all. Let me explain.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.603
Right. We weren't actually fighting.

45:30.978 --> 45:33.439
Then rough flirting?

45:33.898 --> 45:35.233
- No!
- Not at all!

45:47.870 --> 45:50.456
It's five already.

45:50.665 --> 45:54.418
It's my fault for getting
drunk and passing out.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.671
Papa, I'm hungry.

45:58.381 --> 46:01.425
Yor, please return to the hotel.

46:01.801 --> 46:02.760
Huh?

46:03.427 --> 46:06.347
I'll finish shopping and meet you there.

46:06.514 --> 46:07.848
Anya will go too!

46:08.099 --> 46:09.392
Join your mother.

46:10.768 --> 46:15.648
<i>McNally cherry liqueur is
a rare item and hard to find.</i>

46:16.065 --> 46:19.902
<i>I may have to get it illegally.</i>

46:20.278 --> 46:22.530
<i>It'll be easier without these two.</i>

46:24.573 --> 46:27.493
Miss Anya, let's wait at the hotel.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.497
Got it.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.516
Colonel Snidel has arrived!

46:53.769 --> 46:56.439
Route pact with
Republic of Albo completed.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.316
Type F adjusted.

46:58.482 --> 47:02.653
Norida-class battle plane
Enormity ready for takeoff!

47:03.571 --> 47:06.407
Flight plan submitted to HQ.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.035
Good work, Operations Manager.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.121
I award you a long leave.

47:16.417 --> 47:20.296
He's been leaking our strategy to WISE.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.799
Betrayal will be met with death.

47:24.425 --> 47:27.803
Hurry. Let's leave
before he attracts flies.

47:28.054 --> 47:29.180
Excuse me.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.515
Sorry, Colonel.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.683
Later.

47:33.017 --> 47:36.437
Well, in fact... How shall I put it...?

47:36.687 --> 47:39.690
Someone swallowed the microfilm.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.651
What?!

47:43.778 --> 47:46.989
Contact with our agent
in Frigis has ceased.

47:47.531 --> 47:51.077
We suspect Snidel is up to something.

47:51.327 --> 47:54.288
Has he received the microfilm?

47:54.413 --> 47:55.998
That's a strong possibility.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.751
If the Republic of Albo gets it,

47:59.460 --> 48:02.671
it could mean war between East and West.

48:03.464 --> 48:06.384
Fortunately, Twilight is
currently in Frigis.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.844
Twilight...

48:09.261 --> 48:13.766
You guys meet up with Twilight
and seize the microfilm.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.309
I'll do it!

48:15.434 --> 48:16.394
Not you.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.188
I'll handle this without fail!

48:20.731 --> 48:22.233
Hey, follow orders!

48:22.358 --> 48:25.069
Mission with Twilight. ..
Mission with Twilight...

48:25.194 --> 48:26.987
Liqueur... Ligueur...

48:41.669 --> 48:42.503
Negative.

48:50.344 --> 48:51.512
Negative.

49:17.746 --> 49:18.914
<i>Negative!</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:26.297
Hotel!

49:28.174 --> 49:29.842
Hotel TV!

49:31.886 --> 49:33.387
Hotel toilet!

49:35.890 --> 49:37.892
Hotel bed!

49:41.604 --> 49:42.897
Anya too!

49:47.735 --> 49:50.029
You've come prepared.

49:50.446 --> 49:51.989
What's the flashlight for?

49:52.114 --> 49:53.824
Detective game!

49:54.950 --> 49:56.202
And this?

49:58.287 --> 50:02.166
Bad guys! You'll never
get the spy secrets.

50:02.416 --> 50:03.209
Bang!

50:08.047 --> 50:09.757
Are you the boss?

50:13.219 --> 50:15.596
Yes, I'm the boss!

50:16.263 --> 50:20.726
Treasure? Secrets?
We desire their return!

50:22.686 --> 50:25.481
Such a polite lady boss!

50:25.648 --> 50:27.066
Get outside!

50:27.483 --> 50:29.818
The pleasure is mine.

50:36.742 --> 50:40.371
<i>I've looked but the liqueur
is nowhere to be found.</i>

50:40.746 --> 50:43.290
<i>What to do? Time is short.</i>

50:44.166 --> 50:47.336
Franky, you're such a kind man.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.422
You're fun and easy to talk to.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.842
Well...

50:55.344 --> 50:58.097
Can I bring my friend next time?

50:58.389 --> 51:00.266
I've something I'd like to ask.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.102
Of course! What is it you'd...

51:06.397 --> 51:08.232
...like to ask?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.150
Your phone...

51:10.276 --> 51:11.360
Ignore it.

51:11.485 --> 51:12.236
But...

51:13.904 --> 51:15.739
I got a bad feeling about this.

51:16.574 --> 51:18.242
Damn!

51:19.994 --> 51:20.953
Hello?

51:21.078 --> 51:22.037
Its me.

51:22.162 --> 51:23.789
I figured.

51:24.039 --> 51:27.167
Can you get me McNally cherry liqueur?

51:27.293 --> 51:29.795
Aren't you in Frigis?

51:30.045 --> 51:33.257
Yes, but I can't locate any here.

51:33.716 --> 51:35.884
I need it by the morning.

51:36.135 --> 51:37.761
That's kinda sudden.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.346
Can you get it?

51:39.680 --> 51:41.265
I'll try but...

51:41.390 --> 51:42.099
Thanks!

51:42.516 --> 51:44.435
Hang on. Hey!

51:44.768 --> 51:48.022
It takes half a day just to get there!

51:49.940 --> 51:52.651
I did what I can. And now...

52:06.248 --> 52:07.666
I've returned.

52:08.751 --> 52:10.085
Welcome back.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.671
Sorry, I must go out again.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.757
Right now?

52:14.882 --> 52:18.302
There's a liqueur shop in the next town.

52:18.886 --> 52:23.140
It's a bit far but I borrowed
a car from the hotel.

52:23.265 --> 52:24.308
Papa?

52:24.475 --> 52:26.477
I woke you up.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.604
Where are you going?

52:28.729 --> 52:31.607
Still looking for ingredients.
Go back to sleep.

52:38.614 --> 52:39.531
What is it?

52:40.908 --> 52:43.661
Papa, you lied.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.038
You said you'll be back soon.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.124
Right, I'm sorry.

52:49.541 --> 52:54.963
<i>Anya must get a Stella Star or
Operation Strix will be in jeopardy.</i>

52:55.297 --> 52:58.801
And this pref end family
will be over foo.

52:58.967 --> 53:01.512
Family. .. over?

53:01.679 --> 53:02.680
Why?

53:02.930 --> 53:04.264
Anyway, the liqueur...

53:04.390 --> 53:05.265
Papal!

53:05.641 --> 53:07.101
Anya's going too!

53:07.810 --> 53:11.939
No. I'll be back by morning.
Go to bed, okay?

53:16.735 --> 53:19.029
Anya's in the way...

53:22.658 --> 53:24.076
Got it.

53:35.295 --> 53:38.549
Sorry. Please look after Anya.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.095
Um...

53:44.763 --> 53:47.057
How many can ride in the car?

53:48.100 --> 53:49.560
Five, but why?

53:49.685 --> 53:51.937
Why don't we all go together?

53:52.062 --> 53:53.105
Yor...

53:53.564 --> 53:55.065
After all,

53:55.816 --> 53:59.278
it is a family trip.

54:15.210 --> 54:18.172
Is this what Papa wants?

54:20.007 --> 54:21.842
I must tell Papa!

54:25.971 --> 54:28.557
How did you know where it is?

54:28.682 --> 54:32.019
Huh? You're a telepath?
Bond sees the future?

54:35.689 --> 54:38.233
No, I can't tell.

54:45.657 --> 54:47.701
My brother was still little...

54:49.536 --> 54:51.163
Sis!

54:55.209 --> 54:58.504
He was always so jovial on special days

54:58.629 --> 55:01.673
like birth a days and family outings.

55:01.924 --> 55:04.051
Look, Sis!

55:04.384 --> 55:08.388
<i>He seemed happy spending
the entire day with me.</i>

55:11.892 --> 55:13.268
Miss Anya's the same.

55:14.478 --> 55:17.815
She's been elated throughout the trip.

55:27.282 --> 55:30.410
<i>I've had so much excitement
ever since I left the orphanage!</i>

55:30.536 --> 55:31.829
It's all thanks to you, Papa!

55:33.205 --> 55:36.458
She was so looking forward to this trip.

55:36.917 --> 55:41.672
She packed her bag full
of snacks and things for us.

55:42.631 --> 55:46.552
Since I've often left
Yuri feeling lonely,

55:46.844 --> 55:48.679
I understand Miss Anya's feelings.

55:49.221 --> 55:52.349
Anya wants to have fun with you.

55:52.683 --> 55:56.562
It's lonely being
apart from one's family.

56:00.691 --> 56:01.817
Loid.

56:02.401 --> 56:05.612
If you're going, let's all go.

56:06.029 --> 56:10.576
We can allow Miss Anya
to stay up late this one night.

56:16.665 --> 56:18.292
I guess you're right.

56:19.376 --> 56:20.836
Room service.

56:21.253 --> 56:22.921
Did we order something?

56:29.678 --> 56:30.888
Nightfall!

56:32.890 --> 56:36.435
I forgot I'd asked for
a larger sized bathrobe.

56:40.188 --> 56:41.607
Why are you here?

56:41.732 --> 56:43.400
Room service.
I'm on a mission.

56:46.945 --> 56:49.698
Talk normally. It's just us two.

56:49.823 --> 56:50.824
Just us two...

56:50.949 --> 56:52.117
I'm on a mission too.

56:52.284 --> 56:55.495
Just Twilight and me in such a place.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.252
I love you!

57:08.383 --> 57:09.718
Miss Anya?

57:13.972 --> 57:18.018
And so, we're after
the stolen microfilm.

57:18.352 --> 57:22.272
If the Republic of Albo gets it,
it may trigger war.

57:23.565 --> 57:27.611
The special reconnaissance
regiment is after it.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.572
Colonel Snidel is likely in charge.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.240
That guy...

57:32.491 --> 57:34.660
Loid! It's Miss Anya!

57:34.993 --> 57:36.662
She went out the window.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.330
What?

57:40.374 --> 57:42.292
I found this.

57:45.921 --> 57:47.172
Illegible...

57:59.810 --> 58:01.311
There it is!

58:02.604 --> 58:03.689
Anya!

58:03.855 --> 58:05.524
- Miss Anya!
- Anya!

58:05.857 --> 58:06.775
Answer us!

58:07.317 --> 58:09.820
The girl has not been found yet.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.656
That's right.

58:13.031 --> 58:15.617
Squads 7 and 8 are
covering the main road.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.078
We'll continue with the search.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.621
Any luck?

58:19.830 --> 58:21.957
No, but I found this.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.586
Is it credible?

58:26.712 --> 58:28.255
Thank you for shopping!

58:34.720 --> 58:38.390
The Stella Star's mine and
the Forgers stay together.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.439
Maybe not...

58:45.689 --> 58:47.065
Nah.

58:57.367 --> 58:59.661
The chocolate thieves!

59:12.883 --> 59:15.427
Ow! Let go, you old mutt!

59:17.929 --> 59:18.638
Step on it!

59:18.764 --> 59:20.974
I'll take Route 2 East, okay?

59:21.141 --> 59:22.726
Bad fortune in the West.

59:22.934 --> 59:24.936
Whatever, just go!

59:40.994 --> 59:44.206
We'll depart when we have the microfilm.

59:44.372 --> 59:46.041
What about Type F?

59:46.500 --> 59:47.751
Keep it on board.

59:50.545 --> 59:53.090
At this point, war is imminent.

59:53.590 --> 59:56.718
Miss Anya, answer if you hear us!

59:56.885 --> 59:58.637
Miss Anya!

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.306
Where'd she run off to?

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.268
Bond, are you okay?

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.690
Why isn't Anya with you?

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.281
What. .. happened?

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.493
Bond, wait.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.457
That's...?

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.335
Special reconnaissance regiment...

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.212
Has Anya

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.340
<i>gotten in trouble with the military?</i>

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.845
Sir, you dropped something.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.931
The microfilm is top priority.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:46.226
Please put Operation Strix on hold.

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:49.855
Hotel staffer...

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:53.108
Can you help me?

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.406
The guy who stole Anya's dessert!

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:03.535
Before that, you ate our chocolate.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.163
Are you the top robber?

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.456
This is the Colonel!

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.375
Show more respect!

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:15.213
Have you gone since then?

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:18.008
I'm asking if you did number two.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.509
Poo-poo?

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:25.807
<i>How dare she eat the microfilm
hidden in the chocolate.</i>

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:29.728
<i>We'll kill her after she excretes it.</i>

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:36.693
<i>There was treasure in the chocolate?</i>

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.655
Will Anya be killed if she poops?

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:48.747
<i>Anya's so cute that
she's never ever pooped!</i>

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.834
Sorry for lying.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.922
Take her. Report to me
after it's come out.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.757
Aye, sir!

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:01.218
Poop call?

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.512
N...no. I'm just a bit chilly.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:21.613
Let's see if the radio still works.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:25.200
Enormity to airbase.
Following operational orders...

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.661
The channel hasn't changed.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.914
Secret mission to Republic of Albo is go.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:36.836
Subsequent communications will use
GC channel, aviation code 0774.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.381
This is...

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.841
GC 0714.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.843
I'm cold.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.720
That voice! Anya?

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.765
I'm gonna freeze to death...

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.892
Alright, come on!

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:54.729
It's your fault for
swallowing the microfilm.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.773
Swallowing the microfilm?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.150
How on Earth did that happen?

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.907
Looks like Anya's with the military.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.413
I just heard on the radio
they've a little girl in custody.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.999
Military? But how?

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.419
Please stand clear. it'll be back soon.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.346
<i>Were the men who attacked Miss Anya</i>

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.849
from the military?

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.101
<i>But if I tell Loid,</i>

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:37.480
hell find out I beat them up.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:42.444
Why don't we all go together?

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.487
It is a family trip.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:48.616
Family must stick together.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.187
We re counting on you, Twilight.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:25.028
The fate of the world depends on
where the microfilm ends up.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:41.378
Ready?

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.797
No, um...

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.383
Just a dance I do at school.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.802
<i>Got to keep moving or...</i>

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.136
Its coming!

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:54.933
You're late.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:58.019
It's long past your shift.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:01.898
I'm sorry. I'll take it from here.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.276
Who are you?

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.999
Twilight, can you hear me?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.043
According to our sources,

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:26.172
the airship carrying
Colonel Snidel is approximately

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.049
3km north-northeast

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.802
Impressive report in so short a time.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.304
I knew I could depend on you.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.058
<i>...depend on you...depend on you...</i>

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:45.066
Twilight, if you wish,

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.403
<i>I'm prepared to be your life-partner.</i>

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.697
Twilight,

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.950
you should recast me as your wife

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.828
in Operation Strix.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.329
Twilight?

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.959
The line is dead...

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:09.382
Yay, yay! Do the school dance!

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.426
Yay, yay...

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.347
At school, we do this...

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.640
Whoa, it's coming...

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.521
I can't hold it...

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.586
Behold, Poop God.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.588
Poop God?

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.673
Anya, the brave warrior.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:55.303
Fought well, you have.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:00.099
Hardship endured, you've done your
best to preserve world peace.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.228
But it's over. You can let go.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:07.482
Relax your butthole
and rest, brave Anya.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.318
Poop God!

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.986
Correct, my child.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:17.325
Travel now, to the serene Garden of Loo.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.991
Garden of Loo!

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.337
Poo!

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.320
What's Poop God?

01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.989
Toilet time? Come on!

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:39.699
- No way!
- Hey!

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.201
Not yet?

01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:43.953
We're sorry.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.414
Then slash her gut.

01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:48.333
You can do it.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.501
But that's...

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.962
You'll do it.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.214
Yes, sir!

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:59.218
Yellow three, yellow three...

01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:04.390
Yellow three, yellow three...

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.684
What're you doing?

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:11.230
My coffee oracle says
yellow and three are lucky.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:14.192
You're taking this too far.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.653
What'd the Colonel say?

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:24.619
Really?!

01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:25.620
It's your job.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:29.457
No way. He ordered you. You do it!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.250
It's too horrific to do.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.046
Me too. I can't possibly
slash a child's gut

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.049
Rock, paper, scissors...

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.511
Yes!

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:42.512
Damn!

01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:44.222
I'm gonna be killed!

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.724
<i>I'll hold her.</i>

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.976
<i>I'll slash her.</i>

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:52.689
Papa, Mama!

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.237
There it is.

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.990
This is Frigis 0988.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:06.536
We've a fuel line system malfunction.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:10.832
We're in danger and request
emergency landing on your ship.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:15.294
An aircraft is requesting
permission to land.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:16.796
Fire.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.131
But...

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:20.842
I said fire.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.594
Do you read?
Requesting landing permission.

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:36.232
What the...?!

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.788
Can't you down a pesky fly?

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:56.544
No warning shots.
Use guided anti-aircraft missiles.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.171
But,

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:02.383
it's a secret weapon
not allowed during peacetime.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.344
War is brewing. Use it.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.193
A guided missile?

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.009
Loid,

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.595
you fly like a maniac.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.847
I got her!

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.392
Papa! Mama!

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.312
Sorry, kid.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.440
Noooooo!

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:11.118
I've no choice...

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.540
It's approaching!

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:16.874
Down it!

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:33.683
What the...?!

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.561
She's loose!

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.564
Hey, wait!

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.440
It's coming!

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.823
<i>Better look for Anya first.</i>

01:12:56.706 --> 01:13:00.084
Huh? What happened? Loid?

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.463
Loid...

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.883
I must catch up with him.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.719
But I can't get down from here.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.431
In that case...

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:24.150
I'll get in from above!

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:30.448
Check for survivors.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:33.242
A female is approaching.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.702
A female?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.080
She's running across the outer surface.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:40.291
This is no time for jokes.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:44.045
We must break the balance
between East and West.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:56.724
Kill her.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.353
She must have been on that fighter!

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.938
She's an enemy!

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:25.252
Crap, how about a taste of this?

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.137
My my.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:38.849
A hand grenade exploded
in Deck 3A block.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.351
Where's the female?

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:54.281
I've come for my husband and daughter.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:57.410
Oh, you're unconscious.

01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:01.789
The female has entered the ship!

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:03.165
Eliminate her.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:06.669
The explosion has ignited
the fuel system!

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:08.546
<i>It's spreading.</i>

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.089
Extinguish it!

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.508
Now what?

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:15.052
The fire's reached the engine room.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:19.390
Some of you go deal with the fire!

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.850
What about the female?

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.854
Deploy Type F.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:28.065
But that's...

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.276
Obey me.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.195
War has begun.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:41.704
Wait!

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.874
I said wait!

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.045
Where is she?

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.629
This way!

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:55.843
No, over there!

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.887
Damn, where'd she go?

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.741
A toilet!

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.410
You sure she's alone?

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.245
Gotta find her!

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.873
What was that explosion?

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.667
The forced landing damaged their hull.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.379
<i>I'll take advantage of the chaos.</i>

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.466
Get some men in the engine room.

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.941
<i>I'll borrow his identity for a while.</i>

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.278
Hurry!

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:58.489
Before it reaches the ammunition!

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:04.370
Excuse me, I've come for
my husband and daughter.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:07.540
Look! It's the female.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.394
How rude to fire like that.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:35.234
Are these the ones who
attacked Miss Anya on the train?

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.486
If so...

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.743
That was close.

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:53.043
See. My toilet paper
fortune reading is spot on.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.754
No way!

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.758
The child is ours.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:02.595
Good. Bring her to me.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.443
And you would be?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.293
Kindly stand down.

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:39.108
Is that all you've got...

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.945
...intruder?

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.200
I guess I've no choice.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.799
Ammo cooling system has stopped!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.718
Where's the hostage?

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:06.719
Hostage?

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:08.721
Child, about five years old.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:13.642
Warrant Officer Domitri took her
to the command center.

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.353
Command center...

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:19.273
So, you got it out?

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:24.361
Luckily, she used the ship's toilet
so it must be in the waste tank.

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:28.407
It could also still be inside her body.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.452
Keep her in the room downstairs.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:36.040
I'll finish her off
once this nonsense is over.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.709
You will, Colonel?

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.628
To enjoy kebabs,

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:45.632
I just bought a deluxe-sized knife.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.138
Still here? Go already.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:51.930
Yes, sir!

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:54.141
Uh...to where?

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.727
Take a dip in the waste tank

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:59.813
and find the dung-drenched microfilm!

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.357
Or else,

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.235
I'll cut you both up like kebabs.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.279
Y...yes, sir!

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:12.868
Crap, just our luck.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:16.246
It's all that gluttonous brat's fault.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:20.793
My arm still hurts where
that stupid mutt bit me.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:42.898
Excuse me.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:51.407
<i>She's not here. But this
must be the command center.</i>

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:52.991
What is it?

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:56.370
I'm here to report on
the status of the fire.

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:59.415
Later. I'm busy now.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:07.464
They must have taken Anya here,
but where is she?

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.551
Papa! He came for me.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:18.559
<i>I said later.</i>

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:19.935
Step back.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.563
If I stay, hell be suspicious.

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:24.606
<i>What to do?</i>

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.152
<i>Papa, Anya's here!</i>

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:46.628
Papa...

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.423
He noticed.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.102
Excuse me.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.989
Wait, Captain.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.243
When did you start smelling so cultured?

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:29.463
The tourist from Rubble & Bonds!

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.966
Damn, I was so close.

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:35.802
Never underestimate a gourmet's nose.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:39.223
Secure all exits.
Don't let him get away!

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:46.563
He's alone. Surround and Kill him!

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:43.662
That's...!

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:55.173
A toy like that can't scratch me.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:58.051
What shall I do?

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.027
Pretty good. However...

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.075
The poison grenade
is still being developed.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:23.994
Might as well test it.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.455
Poison gas?!

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.832
Papas in trouble.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.603
<i>Anya's...
Anya's gonna save them!</i>

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:54.149
In place of meremere,

01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:57.110
chow down on this!

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:03.200
Gas!

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:08.080
Papa!

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:27.891
What the...?!

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:46.034
Fools! Shoot the imposter!

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:49.162
I'm the real one! Hurry and shoot him!

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:51.289
Bastard!

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:56.128
You re the one with a good nose.

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:59.131
<i>I just have to fool the others.</i>

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:01.091
Cunning bastard,

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:05.303
I'll skin you alive and make
pork rinds out of you!

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:14.688
Skin me alive, huh?

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:21.862
My skin's thicker than anything

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:24.489
a swine like you can cut!

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:37.419
Who won?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.337
Is he the real Colonel?

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:45.802
Do you think I'd lose
to an imposter?

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.680
No! Sorry, sir!

01:27:48.805 --> 01:27:52.434
We must head to the
Republic of Albo immediately.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.311
Abandon ship.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:56.271
Abandon ship?

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.023
Are you serious?

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.067
Soldiers, do as ordered.

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:03.570
The ship won't last.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:07.824
We'll leave and go by
land to carry out the order.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:10.285
All hands abandon ship.

01:28:10.827 --> 01:28:12.621
What about you, Colonel?

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:14.122
Just go!

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:15.373
Aye, sir!

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:19.002
Everyone abandon ship. Hurry!

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.046
Excuse me!

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:39.356
It's futile to wait for
my ammo 10 run out.

01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:44.277
<i>His body is</i>

01:28:44.778 --> 01:28:46.321
Stocked with bullets.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.838
This is your final warning.

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:05.298
Please stand down quietly.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.592
I'm only here

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:11.721
for my husband and daughter.

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:13.139
Cut your cackle.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:17.894
You can all rot
along with the East and West.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.773
Very well.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.408
It's useless.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.536
A knife can't defeat me.

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.626
Lipstick?

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:32.344
Apparently, half of this lipstick

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.804
is made from oil.

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.173
Papal!

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:11.800
Anya!

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:14.469
Papal!

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.850
Are you alright?

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:32.404
Cherry liqueur?

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:33.989
How did you...?

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:36.366
It's what Papa was looking for!

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:40.578
Is this why you snuck out of the hotel?

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:58.596
Let's get out of here.

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.237
- Yor?!
- Mama!

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:16.781
Loid! Miss Anya!

01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:19.075
Mama!

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.704
Are you both okay?

01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:26.082
Yes, how about you?
And why are you here?

01:32:26.666 --> 01:32:31.004
I jumped into your plane
on the spur of the moment.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:32.589
Spur of the moment?

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:34.340
Like, you know,

01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:38.053
we did agree to all go together.

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:40.930
So...

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:43.349
But to come all this way...

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.436
Well, in any case,

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:50.648
are the people on board
really with the military?

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:53.193
Um...they're...

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.361
C...chocolate robbers!

01:32:56.446 --> 01:33:01.409
Anya ate their chocolate on the train
and they came after me!

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:03.870
So, that's why.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:08.333
They hid the microfilm in chocolate.

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:10.919
I've heard of them!

01:33:11.044 --> 01:33:12.420
The Chocolate Robbers!

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:18.301
Chocolate keeps the body warm.
Its theft is rampant in colder regions.

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:21.262
But stealing a military ship...

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:25.892
Oh my. The world is sure
full of horrific people.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:30.021
Did you say you ate
the chocolate by mistake?

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:32.315
What's wrong with you?!

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:34.943
Thank goodness she's alright

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:36.820
That's right, Miss Anya.

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:40.073
Don't touch people's
things without permission!

01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:45.578
I'm sorry...

01:33:57.257 --> 01:34:00.510
We must leave. We're going to crash.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.220
Papa! Mama!

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:10.270
We're headed for that city.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:11.354
Papal!

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:15.817
Before we go, I'll crash
the ship outside the city.

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:18.194
Can you fly it?

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:23.825
When a student, I flew
as a part-time job.

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:30.874
That's Loid.

01:34:31.541 --> 01:34:33.209
Huh? What's that?

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:34.586
It's coming closer.

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:36.045
Is it on fire?

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:37.380
What is it?

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.309
Damn, the propulsion system
and elevators are dead.

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:52.520
Papa, you can do it!

01:34:52.979 --> 01:34:56.232
Don't worry, the rudder still works.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:33.353
Let me help you.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:35.188
Anya too.

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:36.499
Twilight...

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:49.739
Super Exciting Splash!

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:55.453
Why that's...

01:37:57.372 --> 01:37:59.332
<i>the microfilm.</i>

01:37:59.499 --> 01:38:02.126
<i>Was it stuck between her teeth?</i>

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.670
What is that?

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:12.136
It's our ticket home.

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:22.730
The military airship that
crashed in Lake Frigis

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:25.525
was on a training flight ..

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:30.696
<i>Sis went to Frigis.
I hope she's alright.</i>

01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:33.616
Yuri, these documents too.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:38.454
Why do we have to fix their mess?

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:42.291
If this is seen as a military misstep,

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:44.460
it'll stir public unrest.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.883
<i>WISE must have intervened in this case.</i>

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:53.010
But no information is left

01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:55.304
Only one guy could pull this off.

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:58.766
It is him again?... "Twilight"!

01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:07.108
Well done, Twilight.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:09.861
The State Security Service
put out the fire

01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:13.489
but couldn't find
a trace of you guys.

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:14.323
Right.

01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:20.037
The Forgers were simply enjoying
a normal family outing.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.629
By the way, about Operation Strix...

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:31.466
I've an update on that.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:36.637
It's decided that
you'll stay on the case.

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:39.140
Really? What about Depple?

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:44.520
He was caught cheating on his wife.

01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:47.732
His politician father-in-law
disowned him.

01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:50.610
Talk of his replacing you fizzled out.

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:53.946
That guy, you gotta feel sorry for him.

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.407
Such an idiot.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.514
Sorry to be late.

01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:21.015
How was your patient?

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:23.226
It wasn't serious.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:26.729
Not an emergency after all.
Everything's fine.

01:40:26.896 --> 01:40:29.148
That's good.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:31.192
Papal!

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:33.653
No fishies.

01:40:33.819 --> 01:40:35.696
That's cause it's a fountain.

01:40:35.821 --> 01:40:36.781
Mama!

01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:59.971
Although Operation Strix carries on,
I mustn't let my guard down.

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:03.099
We must focus on the Stella Stars.

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:07.353
The Forgers aren't ending?

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:13.192
Let's head home.
You're getting a meremere crash course.

01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:16.571
Crash course, pant pant!

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.033
Mama!

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:24.036
Papa, my hand.

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.504
I'm making yum-yum sweets!

01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:35.339
I'll help too.

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:37.675
Yor, you don't have to...

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.594
Anya can do it myself.

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:43.472
Yes, it's your cooking class, after all.

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:47.310
Anya's gonna do it and win!

01:41:51.439 --> 01:41:53.190
All set.

01:41:53.316 --> 01:41:56.569
I'm making orange-layered cake.

01:41:56.694 --> 01:41:59.280
I practiced with our pastry chef.

01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:01.407
What are you making?

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:03.701
meremere.

01:42:03.868 --> 01:42:05.536
meremere?

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:08.456
What a barbaric dessert.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:15.046
If it turns out yummy,
I want you to try it.

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:19.258
Plan B. The Friendship Scheme.

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:21.177
Anya, that means...

01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:26.307
W...why would I eat crap you make?

01:42:26.849 --> 01:42:27.975
Bastard!

01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:31.312
Am I so awful?

01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:36.400
You dum-dum!

01:42:36.525 --> 01:42:39.654
I'd puke if I ate
anything you made, doofus!

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.072
Doofus!

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:42.990
He's a jerk.

01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:45.660
Plan B. Failure.

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:52.375
Anya is back home!

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:58.005
She must have lost

01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:00.883
Miss Anya, how did cooking class go?

01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:04.887
A big boom.

01:43:05.304 --> 01:43:09.392
"The kitchen malfunctioned and
COOKING class was postponed. ”

01:43:09.642 --> 01:43:13.562
"The judge will be replaced
by the vice principal.”

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:17.149
No principal so no meremere.

01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:18.526
Vice principal...

01:43:18.651 --> 01:43:22.029
The school newsletter
reported his love of

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:24.573
berry pudding from the southern region.

01:43:26.742 --> 01:43:27.660
Shall we go?

01:43:27.993 --> 01:43:29.203
Let's!

01:43:29.495 --> 01:43:30.746
Go!

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.002
This is the southern region.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.672
It's warm there. We can travel light.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.465
It's near the sea.

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:45.136
Sea! Splash! Soak soak!

01:43:45.511 --> 01:43:49.014
We crashed into a lake,
not the sea, Miss Anya.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:51.684
She can learn how to swim.

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.853
Let's bring playing cards too.

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.771
Let's play Old Man!

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:58.524
The game's called Old Maid.

01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:45.120
Hey Loid!

01:49:45.788 --> 01:49:50.292
I got you the McNally cherry liqueur!

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:52.419
Hey!
