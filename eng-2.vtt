"Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion
- R2"

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.380
"Britannian Residential Zone
- Tokyo Settlement"

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.090
This is 2-D-4. We are now entering
Tokyo Settlement-controlled airspace.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.140
Roger that. Your flight objective here
is commercial advertising, correct?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.440
No change in that. As reported,
our flight duration will be for 14 hours.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.690
That's confirmed.
You are cleared for overflight.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.180
Acknowledged. I appreciate it.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.960
We're all that are left now. All that's left
of the Black Knights who, along with Zero,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.280
once struck terror in
the heart of Britannia.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.240
Still, it's too soon to give in to despair!

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.030
If Operation Hien 4 is successful, then...!

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.870
Yeah.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670
Everyone... Forgive me.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.800
Long live Japan!

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.840
Long live Japan!

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.270
Lelouch.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.930
Oh? Again? Persistent, aren't you?

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.270
You won't get away this time!

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.070
Hey! About that thing!

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.270
Sorry! Next time!

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.900
Lelouch, wait!

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.080
Vice Prez!

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.150
Don't let her get you!

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.570
Sure! Sure!

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.410
You lost the moment you turned
this into a contest of physical strength.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.900
Aren't you going a little overboard?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.500
This is just about a
supplementary phys-ed class.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170
Then you should come
to class in the first place!

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.010
I have enough school
credit as it is, don't I?

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.290
It's just colored smoke!

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510
Wait!

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.760
Hang in there, Vice Prez!

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.600
Yeah! Thanks!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.430
What kind of student
council president are you?!

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.810
Oh, so sorry. I wasn't thinking.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.440
Lelouch!

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900
You trying to kill me, Coach?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.270
Rivalz?! When did you...?!

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.600
See you, Rivalz!
I need to borrow your bike!

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.330
Lulu, are you at it again?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.550
<i>Morning and night, I long for you</i>

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.330
<i>I'll become a star and protect you</i>

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.300
<i>No matter where the battle may take me</i>

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.850
<i>At the intersection of
tomorrow and yesterday</i>

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.850
<i>You and I can't be together</i>

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.100
<i>I'm a shooting star, on my way right now</i>

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.900
<i>Even if the world crumbles apart</i>

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.100
<i>There are things which will never change</i>

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.640
<i>Even as we bear tears in our eyes</i>

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.720
<i>There are things we must protect</i>

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.430
<i>A message that's been in my body</i>

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.620
<i>For thousands and millions of years,</i>

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.760
<i>Springs out (I have no reservations)</i>

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.270
<i>Roars out (It's easy)</i>

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.880
<i>In a hoarse voice (Calling tomorrow)</i>

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.170
<i>With my wounded hands (I protect you)</i>

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.120
<i>I continue to fight!</i>

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.600
<i>I continue to fight!</i>

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.480
<i>Morning and night, I long for you</i>

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.940
<i>I'll become a star and protect you</i>

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.230
<i>No matter where the battle may take me</i>

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.740
<i>At the intersection of
tomorrow and yesterday</i>

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.330
<i>You and I can't be together</i>

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.960
<i>I'm a shooting star, tearing fate apart</i>

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.100
<i>I'll take away your
overflowing tears right now</i>

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.880
"The Day a Demon Awakens"

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.810
For crying out loud!
Can't they leave me alone after school?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560
But they only do that because you
cut class all the time, big brother.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.700
Because I find them boring!

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.110
Have some. The prez gave it to me.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.360
Whoa! Whoa!

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.200
But, big brother, you...!

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.460
Yeah, right. Sorry.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.150
It's been a year since the Black Rebellion,
the revolt started by Zero.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.930
Things have finally quieted down,
even here in Area 11.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.680
When the incident began,
all sorts of rumors flew around.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.420
At one point, I thought about going
back to the homeland with my brother.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.930
Did you submit your
career aptitude test yet?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.650
Hm?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.120
That's why Coach Villetta was so upset.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.360
Oh.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.270
Going to university?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.440
I haven't decided yet.
I'm sick of being a student.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.250
Although I'm not ready to be
used by other people yet, either.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.450
Typical answer.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.620
Even if I enter the business world,
what can I hope to accomplish?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.290
I'll still have the big corporations
and the nobility above me.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.660
A fixed world.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.960
I'll just be absorbed into
the hierarchy of adults.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.840
This is not discrimination against Elevens.
It's differentiation!

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.720
The Elevens showed themselves to
be a dangerous, belligerent people...

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.180
who followed the swindler known as Zero and
took to calling themselves "Japanese" again!

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.850
And so we Britannians must
control and educate them!

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.400
The Elevens lost.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.120
They didn't have the strength.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.240
If they'd just kept quiet,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.500
this place wouldn't have been
downgraded to a reeducation Area.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.160
Zero... He was a fool.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.950
No matter what you try, the world is...

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.000
Please hurry, Viceroy Calares.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.420
The delegation from the
Chinese Federation is waiting.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.520
Understood. Anyway, what
about the O.S.I.'s operation?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.430
Yes, my lord. At Babel Tower.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.130
On today of all days...
What could His Majesty be thinking?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.970
I doubt the remnants of the Black Knights
can do anything to us at this point.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.750
Besides, Zero is long since dead.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.980
Quit slacking off, you Eleven monkey!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.860
Y-Yes, sir!

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.670
Target is now arriving, as predicted.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.330
Now entering fifth gate from B-3.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.700
You think she'll show this time?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.130
I certainly hope so.
It's risky to let him leave the settlement.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.920
Very well, then. I just wanted a ride
from you, but if you really want to...

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.450
Today I'll be breaking the law.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.420
If you get arrested, it'll be serious.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.300
The cops don't scare me.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.640
But why do this?
You don't even want money, do you?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.730
Need you ask? It's because I want
to battle even tougher opponents!

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.370
That's a lie. I do this out
of boredom. In short, I'm...

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.060
And now, today's main event,
a match between brothers!

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.440
Will the older brother survive,
or the younger one?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.140
--Odds of the fight going
ten rounds is seven coins.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.140
--Big brother, let's go.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.070
--This place is...

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.810
--A single round
bet will pay off three coins!

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.320
--It's fine. This is simple to figure out.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.140
Observe.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.060
The ones laughing
and having fun are we Britannians.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.230
The ones being laughed at
and working are the Elevens.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.320
You pretend not to notice,
but in the end...

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.480
Then why?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.260
I know, but it's the truth.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.080
The Elevens lost twice. First with Prime
Minister Kururugi and again with Zero.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.120
How could they rebel when
they don't have the strength?

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.640
I'm so sorry!

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.910
No, it's fine.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.880
But, I'm an Eleven and
you're a Britannian student!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.450
All the more reason.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.720
You hate having your position
held over you like a sword, don't you?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.890
Even so, the powerless
have no choice but to bear it.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.760
Even if their opponent is wrong.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.600
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
push your values on me.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.860
I beg your pardon.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.070
Let me see your face. Hm?

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.240
Hmph! Nice goods!

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.660
We've got a large, quality
catch of bunnies today, sir!

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.640
I'm not for sale!

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.580
Oh, yes you are.
Losers don't have any rights!

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.390
Unplanned trouble occurring.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.300
Curse your own birth for not having power.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.420
That's what His Majesty says, right?

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.830
His Majesty...

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.770
The strong eat the weak.
That's the rule of this world!

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.790
Big brother, he's with the Mafia!

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.930
How arrogant.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.850
Are you planning to devour her?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.060
Get lost, student.
This is the grownup world in here.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.660
Well then, will the adult world
eat the student, or vice versa?

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.110
Why don't we answer that with this?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.280
With chess?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.620
Big brother, don't!

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.530
Too late, right, guys?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.440
Students really don't know
anything, do they?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.790
That's not true, Mr. Black King.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.080
You're a famous chess player
in this world, aren't you?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.460
So, you knew who I was, did you?

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.230
If Zero was here, you wouldn't be so tough!

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.850
Don't mention that traitor around me again.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.690
Zero didn't betray us!

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.570
Pipe down!

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.060
Okay! I hear you! I'm sorry!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.610
There must have been circumstances.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.890
Circumstances?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.950
What reason would make the commander
vanish during the decisive battle?!

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.850
Stop it!

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.000
In the end, Zero is still dead!

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.940
Dead?

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.670
Checkmate.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.540
Im-Impossible!

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.040
The student beat him!

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.580
The Black King lost!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.160
How could King have lost so easily?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.580
Looks like it was you who got eaten.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.570
Hm, how troublesome.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.060
I won't be able to show my face
if word of this gets around.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.980
I don't care for spreading rumors.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.240
No, Mr. Student, I mean how
they'll hear how you cheated me!

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.350
Cheated?!

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.460
What a naughty boy you are...

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.160
Wait, please!

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.030
Cheat at chess?!

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.490
There's no way to do that!

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.790
Hold him. Now, to make some evidence...

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.290
You filthy adult!

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.380
Playing fair doesn't win the game, kid!

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.710
Let him go!

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.350
Terrorists?!

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.190
Move out!

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.450
Come on! This way!

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.530
What? Hey!

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.410
Big brother!

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.500
An airship, eh? Their final gasp.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.120
Office of Secret Intelligence,
initiate Operation Valhalla 7.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.720
Yes, my lord!

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.050
What's this?! What's happening?!

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.470
What?!

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.810
Welcome to Area 11.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.020
Such an impressive reception for us.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.400
Although I heard that Zero was dead now.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.490
Zero? No, no.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:07.660
I thought the Chinese Federation would
understand us Britannians better this way.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.080
My... How unusually straightforward.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.580
Hm?

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.240
If we may please have the item on your hip.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.800
Our security is perfect, sir.
You won't need an antique like that.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.770
Xing-ke, how rude of you!

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.680
Forgive me.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.850
I thought your Britannians would understand
the Chinese Federation better this way.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.160
Why, you...

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.730
Wait, what about my bets?!
Gimme my winnings!

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.200
Huh?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.370
Big brother, this way!

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.140
Hey!

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.070
No! Wait!

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.500
What? We've lost sight of the target?!

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.210
Right. We're going in, too.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.960
Understood!

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.850
The terrorists attacking Babel Tower appear
to be armed with several Knightmares.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.230
Ready to commence operation.
Perimeter cleared.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.920
All right, enter seventh sequence.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.530
Commander, Viceroy Calares is...

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.030
Ignore that local bureaucrat.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.970
We're under orders of the emperor himself!

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.160
Yes, my lord.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.830
Let the Elevens use the stairs!

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.120
We're overloaded!

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.160
Don't push!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.660
Terrorists? What are remnants
of the Black Knights doing here?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.800
Britannian soldiers!

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.190
Goddamned Britannians!

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.530
Sorry! I couldn't bring him
here like we planned!

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.610
Don't sweat it! Urabe and the others
are looking for him right now.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.030
Gotcha!

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.990
Rolo! This way!

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.190
What's going on?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.300
That Knightmare before!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.930
Was it... protecting me?

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.290
Big brother, what'll we do?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.570
Don't worry.
We'll get out of here, I promise.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.240
I'll get us out.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.250
S-Sure. We will.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.390
Rolo!

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.850
Big brother!

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.020
Now Lulu's dragging
Rolo into his bad habits!

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.050
Why not just admit that you're
worried about your darling Lulu?

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.060
I am not!

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.400
There she goes again.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.320
Jeez...

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.490
R-Rolo?

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.150
Rolo!

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.500
I can't get through!

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.720
Now what?
At this rate, we'll both be...!

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.950
No! I have to try and save him!

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.900
I have to be able to save
my only brother, at least!

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.270
Even I must have that much strength!

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.980
Even I...!

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.490
The terrorists did this?!

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.730
But... The Elevens were killed, too!

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.270
Are they still relying on Zero?

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.000
The Black Knights!

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.170
Do they want to kill me?

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.300
What do I do?! Even if I run away...

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.590
Lelouch.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.500
I came for you, Lelouch.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.520
I'm on your side.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.270
Your enemy is Britannia.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.980
We have a contract.
We're both accomplices.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.800
Contract? Accomplices?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.660
Only I know. The real you.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.100
The real me?

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.970
Le... louch...

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.440
H-Hey!

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.980
Britannian soldiers?!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.040
W-Wait, what are you?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.820
Stop it! She's still alive!

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.120
You've served your purpose well,
Lelouch Lamperouge.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.540
Purpose? What are you talking about?!

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.710
We've had our eye
on you for a long time now.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.100
6:59 AM... Awakens.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.050
7:12 AM... Watches the news with his
little brother while eating breakfast.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.290
No ideological deviations
with what he sees.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.300
8:45 AM... Goes to school.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.000
Cuts homeroom and first period class.
Instead, reads on the roof.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.310
Second hour, for his physics class...

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.730
That's... what I did today...

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.280
Perhaps you can call it
a breeding log. For our bait.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.200
Bait?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.260
Or call it a trap if you wish.
For that witch.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.560
All to lure C.C. out of hiding!

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.700
Wait, please! What are you talking about?!

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.370
I'm a baron, boy, and as such
I have no further words for my bait!

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.540
Now, time to dispose of you.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.960
There can't be any witnesses left.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.880
Dispose?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.360
Is this the end for me?

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.860
Without knowing anything? So easily?

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.920
To hell with that!

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.940
Power! If I just had power!

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.550
Power to get out of here!

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.650
Power to not lose to the world!

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.860
What... What is this?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.290
You desire power?

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.300
That voice... The girl from before?

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.630
You already possess
the power you seek.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.930
It's just imprisoned
in a cage of amnesia.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.470
Remember.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.400
Who you really are!

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.900
The power of the king!

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.230
Let the seal now be broken!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.930
I see now...

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.660
The irritation which pricked me
like thorns in my everyday life.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.770
Yes... It was all phony memories.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.040
I remember now...

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.910
I am...

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.750
I am...!

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.900
I am... Zero!

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.140
Lelouch, I won't ask for forgiveness.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.040
We're friends, aren't we?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.880
Yes... That's your answer,
isn't it, Suzaku?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.450
Before you dispose of me,
I'd like you to answer a question.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.610
That girl's still alive!

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.940
Impossible! She was shot through the heart!

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.540
If it's wrong to be powerless,
does having power make you right?

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.770
Is vengeance wrong?
Is friendship right?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.380
There is no right or wrong.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.680
The only reality left for
bait is simply death.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.470
I see. Then that reality is
all that is left for you as well.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.480
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you!

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.420
All of you... <i>die</i>!

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.350
It... It can't be!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.410
Yes, Your Highness!

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.470
Ever since that day,
my heart just couldn't accept it.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.330
This phony life I couldn't
fit into. The lost time.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.630
These other memories planted within
me to give me a life as one of the herd.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.470
But the truth continues
to lead me to itself.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.960
That's right!

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.440
It wasn't me
who was wrong! It's the world!

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.570
The world will change. I will change it!

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.960
Pardon the wait, Master Zero!

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.570
Please, give us your orders!

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.660
Very well!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.160
After all...

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.080
I am Zero!
The man who will destroy the world!

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.100
The man who will create the world anew!

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.430
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.880
I have no intention of
giving this job to anyone else.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.240
The one who will kill Zero... shall be me.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.450
<i>Someday let's try to pick up and rebuild</i>

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:27.960
<i>The fragments of happiness in our hearts</i>

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.080
<i>That nearly forgotten melody</i>

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:40.830
<i>Stay vivid, deep inside of me</i>

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:47.950
<i>I thank you from the bottom of my heart</i>

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:53.330
<i>Everything I have now, I owe to everyone</i>

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:58.000
<i>I thank you from the bottom of my heart</i>

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.920
<i>Next I'll send happiness to everyone</i>

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:09.500
<i>I won't forget anything</i>

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:16.040
<i>Because I'm still the
same as I was that day</i>

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.160
<i>You need me to keep on saying</i>

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.230
<i>How much I love you</i>

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:31.910
<i>On those long nights,
your tears about to overflow</i>

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.250
<i>Just turn around</i>

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.400
<i>Follow those footprints</i>

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:48.840
<i>So that you'll never forget that day</i>

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.870
I can't forgive them.
I mustn't forgive them!

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.200
My memories are my own reality!

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.600
My own personal truth!

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.500
There is someone who trampled them,
made me into his livestock.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.790
Who looked down on me
as mere bait for his trap!

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.160
The time for payback has come!

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.650
I'll make Britannia remember the true
meaning of Zero's return to this world.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.220
Because I have no more
need for their phony rule.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.280
"Plan for Independent Japan"
